# React-Dashboard-Demo
A reporting dashboard I developed as part of learning React.JS. This project was developed in a Docker environment and intended to be deployed on a service like AWS in a real-world situation.

# Resources used in this project:
- Packages and dependencies managed by Yarn package manager
- Code developed within a containerized Docker environment https://www.docker.com/. Partly to gain experience with   
    this exciting new tool, but also to gain the many benefits of Docker (including elminating the influence of the local dev environment on the code).
- These beautiful graphs were created using the react-chartjs-2 library https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-chartjs-2
    (In future I plan on looking into d3.JS https://d3js.org/ to create more customized components)
- Started from the create-react-app boilerplate code by Facebook which you can find here:
