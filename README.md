# React-Dashboard-Demo
A reporting dashboard I am developing as part of learning React.JS & Node.JS. This project is being developed in a Docker environment and would be deployed on a service like AWS in a real-world situation.

# Resources used in this project:
- Packages and dependencies managed by Yarn package manager which you can find here: https://yarnpkg.com/en/
- These beautiful graphs are created with the react-chartjs-2 library: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-chartjs-2.  
    In future I plan on looking into d3.JS https://d3js.org/ to create more customized components.
- Started from the create-react-app project by Facebook found here: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app
- Server code is based on the express.js web application framework: https://expressjs.com/
- Code developed within a containerized Docker environment https://www.docker.com/.  
    This is partly to gain experience with this exciting new tool, but also to gain the many benefits of Docker (including minimizing the influence of the local dev environment on the code).
